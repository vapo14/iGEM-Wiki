                Safety in research refers to the practices and principles
                 that one shall follow to prevent exposure to biological 
                 organisms, products, or material; their accidental release; 
                 or any potential harm they may cause to any individual,

            <h3>Recognize Hazards</h3>
            <p class="warning-content">

                 
                Hazard: a potential source of danger to a vulnerable target
                It involves:
                Comprehension of the descriptive terms regarding hazards.
                Knowing how to interpret chemical labels, Safety Data Sheets,
                and other safety information resources. 
            </p>
            <h3>Assess Risks</h3> 
            <p class="warning-content">
               
                To evaluate risks from exposure to hazards:
                Consider both products and circumstances.
                How can the risk be prevented or controlled?
            </p>
            <h3>Minimize Risks</h3> 
            <p class="warning-content">
               
                Design experiments to minimize any hazards exposure and risks.
                Handle, store, and dispose wastes properly.
                Review and learn from past incidents.
            </p>
            <h3>Prepare for Emergencies</h3>
            <p class="warning-content">
                
                Fires, injuries, spills.
                How to react correctly to an emergency.
                Clear labeling and accessible location of safety devices (showers, eye washes, fire extinguishers, spill kits)
                Understandable and straightforward emergency plan, including emergency phone numbers, alarms and escape routes.

                Before starting our work in the lab, all team members had to 
                pass different safety tests and receive training. Those 
                tests included an introduction to laboratory equipment (i.e. 
                centrifuge, plate reader, gel chamber, autoclaves, biosafety 
                cabinets) and covered the use of chemicals (i.e. chloroform, 
                phenol, staining reagents). We made sure all of our team 
                members (Biotechnological Engineering students) received the 
                proper training and certifications , regardless of their 
                area (Human Practices, Entrepreneurship) foreseeing any 
                situation out of the ordinary which could compromise their 
                safety. That way all of the team was prepared for any 
                incident. 
        </p>
        <p>
                Prior to starting the lab work. all team members completed 
                several courses provided by the Public Health Agency of 
                Canada web page, and were certified by them.

As part of our protocols, we disinfected the cabinet with 70% ethanol and turned the UV light for 15 minutes minimum before using the biosafety cabinets. When introducing our hands or any other material we sprayed them thoroughly with 70% ethanol. Finally, when done using the biosafety cabinets, we made sure to clean them and let the UV light sterilize them for another 15 minutes.

                   <h3>Laboratory Access</h3>
                <p> The laboratories we worked in are categorized as Containment Level 2 Laboratories. These laboratories have lockable doors and access is restricted to Biotechnology alumni and Faculty teachers. Students must complete a safety course before being granted access to any of the laboratories, as all of us did. 
                    </p>
                    <h3>Waste Management</h3>
                   <p>Laboratory waste is usually classified into four types depending on their nature, and each of them should be disposed accordingly in order to avoid accidents or contamination. Non-solid biological wastes, such as fluids, go in a yellow hermetic bottle, while solid biological wastes should be disposed in a yellow bag. Sharp objects must be disposed in a thick red plastic bottle. Objects and materials that were in contact with bacteria or any kind of infectious agent should be disposed in a red bag. These last two options were how the waste generated during our experiments was disposed of, since we only worked with waste of that nature.

        Choosing a non-pathogenic chasis.

           <p>Tec-Chihuahua values safe laboratory practices and recognizes the importance of minimizing risks to the team, our community and the environment. This is why we decided to use a non-pathogenic chassis. We chose three strains of E. coli : DH5α for vector cloning and BL21 DE3 and Shuffle T7 for protein expression. These strains are classified as Risk Group 1 organisms and generally do not cause disease in healthy adult humans nor represent a risk to the environment. 
           </p>
           <p>
                Despite the low level of risk associated with them, all protocols involving these organisms were performed in a biosafety cabinet while wearing PPE.

        <i>Verticillium dahliae</i>
    </div>
    <div class="container col-md-7 safety-panel"    id="sfty-acc8">
           <p>
                Our project involved direct work with Verticillium wilt, a fungal plant disease caused by the facultative parasite ascomycete Verticillium dahliae. Getting to know the main characteristics of this fungus and developing the right containment methods to avoid accidental release, was indispensable for the correct development of our project. 

           </p>
           <p>
                According to DSMZ, Verticillium dahliae falls within Risk 1 Group representing a low potential risk. 2 Biological safety and biocontainment practices followed to ensure proper management of the fungus include the following:
                <ul id="safety-courses">
                    <li>
                            Wearing a laboratory coat, face masks,  gloves and eye protection when working with the mould cultures

                    </li>
                    <li>
                            Regular cleaning of laboratory attire and personal clothing

                    </li>
                    <li>
                            Washing our hands after working with the pathogens and before leaving the laboratory

                    </li>
                    <li>
                            Decontaminating work surfaces after completion of work and after any spill of the fungus

                    </li>
                    <li>
                            Leaving our personal belongings away from the lab 

                    </li>
                    <li>
                            Regular decontamination of laboratory equipment and materials.

                    </li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <p>
                
It should be noted that the handling of this fungus was done by lighting a burner in the working area to create a sterile zone. An individual incubator was designated solely for the storage of our fungi. In this way we minimized any contamination risk.
