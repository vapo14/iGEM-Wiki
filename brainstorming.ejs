<i>S. aureus</i> is a Gram-positive bacterium that creates a biofilm which sticks to tissues and implanted medical materials. Due to this, <i>S. aureus</i> is resistant to antibiotics and less vulnerable* to antimicrobial and immune defenses. Our plan was to produce and purify recombinant enzymes that have shown antimicrobial activity against the biofilm and, in that way, offer a therapeutic solution.

                    In our state there are a lot of water bodies contaminated by this heavy metal, which is extremely polluted and harmful for people’s health. This idea consisted of taking a protein from <i>Cupriavidus metallidurans</i> called <i>PbrR</i>, which has lead affinity and therefore, modify <i>E. coli C41</i> (DE3) to remove lead from water. This way, the water quality in our state could improve and also improve the lives of people affected by this contaminant.

                    We identified the problem of hard-to-treat wounds such as diabetic ulcers and other chronic wounds. An alternative treatment based on the use of larvae of the green bottle fly (<i>Lucilia sericata</i>) has shown effectiveness on healing these wounds due to the peptides and enzymes released in the insect's secretions. Our objective was to produce a hydrogel that contained three of these proteins to accelerate the debridement process and prevent bacterial infections.
